# BRM UV Tools

This script will add the ability to translate, scale and rotate UV coordinates directly in the 3D Viewport. It should be very useful for 3D artists who find themselves working often with tiling textures that don't require a clean UV layout. Level editing packages such as hammer commonly allow you to edit UV coordinates without a 2D uv editor, and this replicates this type of functionality in Blender. I'm sure there are many other uses too.

Installation:
download the repository, and in Blender's user preferences install BRM_UVTools.py
once activated, you can find BRM UVTools in the tools panel when in edit mode, under "Shading/UVs"

I highly recommend creating a keyboard shortcut for each tool. You can right click the button and add a shortcut easily.

some keyboard combos can be used while running the tool:
-X: constrain translate/scale to x-axis
-Y: constrain translate/scale to y-axis
-SHIFT: precision mode
-CTRL: stepped mode
-CTRL+SHIFT: stepped mode with smaller intervals
